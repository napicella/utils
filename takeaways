- Use swagger for everything in the CFN template instead of the Events property of AWS::Serverless::Function, much better documented and friendly!
- Explicitely add permission to API gateway to call your lambda (this should ve been done by SAM behind the scene for you)
  # Current workaround needed for error:
  # "Execution failed due to configuration error: Invalid permissions on Lambda function."
  # See https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/issues/59
  # It's possibly a bug in SAM that does not appear to have been fixed
  ConfigLambdaPermission:
    Type: "AWS::Lambda::Permission"
    DependsOn:
      - CustomAuthorizerFunction
    Properties:
      Action: lambda:InvokeFunction
      FunctionName: !Ref CustomAuthorizerFunction
      Principal: apigateway.amazonaws.com
